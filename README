This is a simple platform game with the goal being to eliminate
all of the monsters by jumping on them. The player must avoid
comming in contact with monsters to avoid losing the game. The
monsters constantly spawn so it should be a challenge for the 
player to eliminate them all.

This is a simple game I slapped together in about a week. It's
clearly very unfinished. I wrote it because I wanted to mess
around with some C which I haven't done in a long while. If I
had the time or inclination, there are a number of things I
would add, such as:
 Animated Sprites
 Transparency
 Better Collision Detection
 More Monster Types
 Better Platform Graphics
 A Top Scrolling Screen
 A Proper Animation for Dying Monsters

The only dependency this game has is SDL so it should be easy to
compile with gcc or clang.
